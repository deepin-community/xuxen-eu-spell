XUXEN III Open Source

XUXEN III Open Source is based on XUXEN II, which has the following
features:

XUXEN III has all the features of XUXEN II, but since then there have
been some changes. In this version, apart from bug-cleaning, this new
features have been added:

* All the lists from "Hiztegi Batua" ("Unified Dictionary") of
  Euskaltzaindia (The Royal Academy of the Basque Language) have been
  verified and all the new rules since December 2004 have been taken
  into account.

* Most common names/surnames of the census of the Basque Autonomous
  Community: Surnames with a frequency over 500 and names over
  100. There has not been taken any specific criterion about
  normalization and there has not been made any differentiation
  between Basque or Spanish spelling for deciding is a name is correct
  or not. E.g.: Carlos, Karlos, Javier, Jabier,, Xabier, Arroyo,
  Urruticoechea, Urrutikoetxea are all considered correct.

* Some place and organization names: Amann, Asegarce.

* Terminology from the Science and Technical Corpus of Elhuyar
  (standard and not-standard). E.g.: biomediko, supramolekula.

* Corrections sent by users; especially the lists received from
  Elhuyar. E.g. The not-standard word espaziuntzi and its standard
  espazio-ontzi.
