Description: Temporarily set hunspell/eu-ES.aff encoding back to ISO-8859-1.
Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/828763

Upstream sources are inconsistent, .aff file is UTF-8 and declared as such,
but .dic file is encoded as ISO-8859-1.

Minimal change to .aff file to make both consistent. This patch is smaller
than patching .dic file to make it UTF-8, so I go this way.
